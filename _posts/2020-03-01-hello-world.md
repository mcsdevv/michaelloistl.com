> "Hello World" is often the first program written by people learning to code, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language.

I'm a programer and I have used those two words on many programming related occasions, however today I want to use them "literally" and say "Hello World" related to our new journey as digital nomads traveling the world.

About 2 month ago, my wife and I decided to give up our flat in East London to travel the world as digital nomads. I wrote about this decision and what got us to this point in [Our next chapter](https://michaelloistl.com/20200202-our-next-chapter){:target="_blank"}.

We have since cleared our flat and reduced our belongings to one suitcase, one carry-on luggage and a backpack (check out [this instagram post](https://instagram.com/p/B9KqffYlzJ8){:target="_blank"} to see us and everything we take with us), and yesterday we took a one-way flight to Lisbon (Portugal) where we spend our first 4 weeks before moving further south.

Although we had spent the last few weeks preparing for this new chapter in our lives, the actual departure from London felt more like going on holiday rather than a one way flight into a new way of living, which was quite interesting.

For us, this new chapter is not just a change of location(s) but a new start of creative work we both want to focus on. 

I used to be an architect but transitioned into software development over the last 10 years. Now it's time to bring those two professions back together with a new service for architects, that I have been working on during my free time  for the better part of the last year. I'll share more on this in upcoming posts...

My wife loves illustrating, photography and is now expanding into videography to share our story and experiences via [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2dzWCzIcp7PkRuGxSH4ATQ){:target="_blank"} and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lauza_and_michael){:target="_blank"} to hopefully inspire others to do what they love.

While we are sharing our journey, our learnings and everything that comes with this new way of living via Youtube, Instagram and a soon to come website, I want to keep writing my personal, more work related, experiences here on my personal blog as I find this helping me to bring more consciousness to my actions and decisions.
