Every person has their own ideas, opinions and believes. All of those are the result of some personal experiences and more and more external influences. For each person the resulting views are the "right" views, often without much questioning.

Talking with others, we often choose to be "right", defending our views, rather than being open to listen for theirs. This being "right" results more often than not in conflicts, disagreement and divide.

Nobody has ever been hurt by listening another person and accepting their ideas, views, opinions and beliefs for what they are; they are theirs. You don't have to agree, or change, but accept that other people have theirs.

When you are open and curious to discover what other people think, you might even discover something new for yourself. Something that's not the same than yours, not against yours, but complimenting or expanding.

Give it a try and listen.

Happy holidays.
